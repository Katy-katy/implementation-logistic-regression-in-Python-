# Implementation Of Logistic Regression in Python

I did this small project as an assignment for “Machine Learning Nano Degree” program at udacity.com. My goal was to implement Logistic Regression using only Python and Numpy to predict the number of entering people for NY subway. I used gradient descent with different Alfa values and different number of iterations. I used the coefficient of determination (R2) to measure how well my algorithm works.
